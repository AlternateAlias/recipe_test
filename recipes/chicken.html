<h2>Description of Recipe:</h2>
<p1>This recipe will require 30 saltine crackers, 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
    2 tablespoons of dry potato flakes, 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, 1 and a half teaspoons of ground black pepper
    one egg, six skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, and 2 cups of vegetable oil for frying.
</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>First, you place the crackers in a large plastic bag, seal the bag, and then crush the crackers
    with a rolling pin until they are crumbs (not too fine, just enough to where they're in chunks but broken anyway).
    Then, add the flour, potato flakes, salt/pepper and mix. Second, you beat the egg until it is a liquid yolk.
    Coat the cricken pieces in this egg, one by one, and then place in crumb mixture. Seal said bag and shake it until all pieces are coated.
    Third, heat oil in a deep-fryer or saucepan of choice to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, or 175 Degrees Celsius. Lastly, fry the chicken (turning in random intervals to heat both sides)
    until it is a golden brown color. Drain the juices after, and enjoy!
